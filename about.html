      Hey! <b>I'm Karan V Upamanyu.</b>
      <br><br>
      I conduct placement classes to help engineering students crack placements at tech companies, with my preparation experience that has landed me offers from PharmEasy, Oracle and Cognizant among others.

    <h2>A COOL STORY</h2>
    <p>
      This is about how I got through my placement season!
      <br><br>
      So it was early July or something and I hadn't even started preparing for my placements. That's when we got an email from our college's placement cell- "campus placements start July 15th". I wasn't even scared though. I've been a pretty decent student, and I thought I could get through it easily.  ‚ÄúIf even I couldn't get a job, who else could ?‚Äù
    </p>
    <p class="stylized-p" style="text-align: center;">
      ‚ÄúI don't know how to say this but,
      <br>
      I'm kind of a big deal.‚Äù
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: right;">-Anchorman</p>
    <p>
      Boy oh boy, I was wrong.
      <br>
      The first few tests were alright. I kind of winged them. But when the big companies came with serious packages, I started taking a beating.
      <br>
      The first such company was Cloudera. They had a coding round first. Results came in, and I found out I had flunked.
      <br>
      My morale took a HUGE hit. But I still had faith in myself. I knew I'd get through the next big test.
      <br>
      And then, Endurance came with another serious package. I wrote the test. Guess what happened this time?
      <br>
      Yeah, flunked again.
      <br>
      My morale was now at an all time low. But I took that up as a challenge. The hero makes a comeback! (*whistle* *whistle*). I went to a shop the very next day, and bought a study table and a chair setup. And made a study timetable. And it wasn't much of a time table, basically all I did was study, with no breaks except for human needs.
      <br>
      I'd wake up and prepare. Get cleaned up, eat my breakfast, and prepare. Then take a break for lunch, go back and prepare. It's evening, I have a headache, doesn't matter, prepare. Eat my dinner, then prepare. Sleep. Dream of code. The cycle went on. And it went on for a whole month.
      <br><br>
      I got quick results. In the next one month, I scored 4 job offers. I was elated and my efforts had paid off. And the rest is history. (I've always wanted to use that lineüòÇ)
      <p class="stylized-p" style="text-align: center;">
        ‚ÄúTry try try till you are success.‚Äù
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: right;">-My school's Sanskrit teacher</p>
    </p>
    <p>
      What's the key takeaway from this?
      <br>
      People not getting jobs and suffering is a real thing. It might not have hit you yet, but it's something you'll see very soon.
      <br>
      The best time to start preparing was a year ago, the second best time is now!
      <br>
      On that note, why don't you register to my course? *wink*
